                        <em>Grimund Bronzeheart</em>: a dwarf, way too pale to be one, but one still. At 1,4m and 122kg he’s big and heavy, even by dwarven standards. His nose long, his hair white and his beard fiery red. He covers his eyes as best as his hood allows him, they’re yellow, reddish perhaps.

                        4 silver pieces lighter, <em>Grimund</em> finds some solace, and much needed warmth.

                        After eating and drinking, he pulls out a golden locket, with a red stone embedded on its lid; and a set of jeweler’s tools. As he’s working on his little piece of treasure, a strange, hooded figure sits next to him and says:
                    </p>
                    <p class="fw-bold text__paragraph--align">
                        - Haven’t seen you here before. Peculiar mark, how did you get it?
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        The mark is a Fanged-Skull-like burn taking almost his entire right forearm. <em>Grimund</em>, quick to cover it, grunts:
                    </p>
                    <p class="fw-bold text__paragraph--align">
                        - None of your business, mate.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fw-bold text__paragraph--align">
                        - Ah, but maybe it is my business, maybe I‘m just curious. Maybe, you want to tell your story to someone.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        For some weird reason the dwarf couldn’t refuse the stranger, and started retelling his past misadventures.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        <b>- This happened 100 years ago.</b> -- He said.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fw-bold text__paragraph--align">
                        - I was still a young dwarven blacksmith.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        So it was, at the age of 50, just a child by dwarf standards, <em>Grimund</em> started his blacksmith training. By age 64 he had his own shop, and a family, he was happy… he isn’t anymore.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        During that year, an orcish invasion raided Dhalborim, it took everyone by surprise, the guards couldn’t do anything to stop it. Of course they weren’t alone. They might have been the best trained individuals in the city, but they weren’t alone. Most dwarves get combat training, so most dwarves fought the invasion.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        Little did it help, no matter how many orcs they felled, more kept on coming. They first took the gates, followed by the outer rims of the city. The advance didn’t stop until they reached the keep. In there, dwarves not fit for battle, children, merchants and tourists, were hiding. <em>Grimund</em>’s family was there. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        Desperation took hold of the dwarf, there was nothing he could do to save them. So he prayed. He prayed to anyone who would listen: old gods, new gods, demons. It didn’t matter, he needed help, he wanted the power to save his people.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        <em>Bronzeheart</em> got lucky, something did listen. Everything went dark, and in his mind, they spoke:

                        - Take us from our resting place then. In exchange, The Destroyer only asks that you bring destruction upon your fickle world.

                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        As he lifted the sword, the weapon changed forms, turning into a gilded Warhammer.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        And so, <em>Grimund</em> found himself, and a small group of dwarf warriors surrounded by orcs, at the gates of the keep. A blinding rage took the dwarf’s reason. Hammer in hand he charged. Some orcs died under the mighty hammer, some simply vanished from existence after getting hit. No matter how many of them <em>Grimund</em> killed, orcs kept coming.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fw-bold text__paragraph--align">
                        - You promised me power in exchange for destruction! Give me the power to destroy then! Fulfill your part of the bargain!
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        As <em>Bronzeheart</em> shouted this, black fire caught the hammers head, the hilt next, and finally <em>Grimund</em>. This fire did not burn, not him at least. Wherever he placed his sight, he could instantly travel, dead hands would come out of the ground and walls to seize whatever passed near. Simply by shouting at some orcs made them fall, some would later rise from the dead to fight their kinfolk. A few hours later, the dwarf had either burnt, killed or simply made the orcs disappear… and a big part of the city with them.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        After the horde was gone, the hammer vanished in thin air and the black fire left <em>Grimund</em>, except for a patch in his right forearm, here it burned him, and it did so deeply, leaving the mark. After the fire died, the dwarf fell to his knees and the voices spoke once more:
                    </p>
                    <p class="fw-bold text__paragraph--align">
                        - Well done, our pet. We’ll take this as the initial payment, as per our agreement.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        Then, <em>Bronzeheart</em> blacked out.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        A week later, <em>Grimund</em> wakes up, he’s home. His family’s there with the dwarven high council. They hail him a hero.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        After a walk around the city, and talking to some of the survivors, he realizes his actions caused more than half of the city’s destruction, and a good number of dwarf casualties. Still, everyone seems to think of him as a hero. Orcsbane they call him. He hates it. He thinks it should be Dwarvesbane.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        Another week passes, and <em>Grimund</em> can’t take it anymore, he’s the cause of all that pain and suffering, he’s dangerous. He leaves his family, his clan, and his city behind. He tells himself it’s for the best, he’d hurt them if he stayed.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        The dwarf sets on a quest to get rid of his newly acquired curse. In his travels he learns a thing or two about Legion, Abbadon, and their cults.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        He’s made his mind, he’ll use these destructive powers for good, he’ll help anyone that needs it and fight against evil, until he finds a way to lift the curse, or better still, vanish the Destroyer.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        His powers are nowhere what they were that night, he can no longer materialize a weapon, he can’t travel instantly, or make enemies disappear anymore, but slowly he learns to control whatever power he has left. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        This is the story of his mark and how he got to the inn, as he told it to the hooded figure.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        After he finishes his story, the cloaked man speaks:
                    </p>
                    <p class="fw-bold text__paragraph--align">
                        - Our Lords are satisfied by your deeds so far, dwarf. They’re confident you’ll destroy the world before you find them. However the cult of the Great Legion isn’t as happy, and we’ll make sure you don’t become a hazard, Brother.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        The cultist then stands up, making a mark similar to <em>Bronzeheart</em>’s, visible under his left ear and touches <em>Grimund</em>’s, making it burn unbearably.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        Our hero wakes up on a bed, at the inn. It was all a dream, he’s had worst and makes none of it. It’s time to leave and continue the righteous search.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        In the town’s market, a man with the Fanged-Skull mark under his left ear is buying jade and carving tools.
