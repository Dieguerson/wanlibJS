                        Li Xue and Yang Baozhai were denizens of Yumai, a little town on the Eastern mountains. They made their living as mountain goats herders and lived in a small shack somewhat removed from the town, on Chen Qiang’s lands, a landlord and a childhood friend of Li Xue. <em>Li Zhu</em>’s parent’s shack was small, so, during the last few weeks of the pregnancy, Chen Qiang invited them to the main house, where they would have more space for the birth. <em>Li Zhu</em> was born during the night and his father gave him his name because of the power of his screams.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        One day, when <em>Li Zhu</em> was four years old, his father went to do his daily chores, but at nightfall he didn’t return, and Li Xue was never again seen in Yumai. Chen Qiang and a group of hunters, farmers and acquaintances searched for him three weeks. Finally, they declared them dead, since no one could conceive Li Xue dishonoring himself by abandoning his family.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        Che Qiang would have never kicked Yang Baozhai off his lands, but still, she started looking for work, to provide for the little one. Eventually the governor gave her work as a house maid, so Yang Baozhai move to the staff house. In time, the governor fell in love with her and they got married. <em>Li Zhu</em> had seven step siblings and was never treated differently by his stepfather. Although he was frequently chastised for disappearing hours on end, going into the mountains. Given his exploring spirit and his lack of interest in people, the kids in town ignored <em>Li Zhu</em>.

                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        During his incursions, the young one took advantage of the loneliness and nature’s company to become isolated and search for inner peace, some times through meditations, others by climbing the mountain sides or bathing under the waterfalls. During one of his meditations, he managed to connect with the spirit of Zun-Gun, the Kind One, Master of Wishes, who gave him a little fragment of knowledge. So, <em>Li Zhu</em> found that, if he headed into the mountains in search of the only smooth wall of the region, he would find a small bell, symbol of Zun-Gun and a splinter of Everything, the god that, after creating the world, disappeared by crystalizing itself into uncountable fragments; made from amber stone. With this in mind, at 15, <em>Li Zhu</em> said goodbye to his family and started a life of reclusion in the mountains in search of spiritual enlightenment.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        During this time, he dedicated himself to meditation and a rigorous training. Finally, he found the bell and it guided him to a narrow and treacherous path carved in stone. His curious nature and the power of Zun-Gun’s symbol pushed him to follow it. At the end he found a monastery.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        Seeing someone approaching by the mountainside, the monks went to the young man and offered him food and a place of rest. Nearing dawn, the head of the monastery approached <em>Li Zhu</em> and started talking to him, interested in how he found the secret path. After hearing the story, the old man fell silent for a while. When he finally spoke again, he offered <em>Li Zhu</em> a place in the monastery. According to the old man, the young one was worthy of it, since no one who wasn’t could have reached the end of the Path. Besides, the young one’s lack of discipline and his savage nature could be corrected and focused for a greater good, towards a new path and the search of enlightenment. <em>Li Zhu</em> promised to consider it and after a night in the monastery, his first one under a roof in three years, decided to stay, becoming a Monk of the Way of the Kensei. With time and the bell’s influence, he became a master of the Jian, a traditional short sword. One day, seemingly like any other, his sensei told him the path of enlightenment resided in the knowledge of the world, the temple had fulfilled its part, <em>Li Zhu</em> wasn’t a savage and undisciplined youth anymore, he was an experienced monk worthy of going out into the world as a representative for the order. The following day <em>Li Zhu</em> abandoned the temple and begun his travels in search of a way to reach enlightenment.

                        Life took him to diverse places, to meet the weirdest of characters. Among them stands out Atefeh Almasi, a human sorceress that got her powers through her ascendancy, that traced back to the first children of The Mother and The Father. Atefeh, by virtue of her power, was the only woman on Breland’s Army and, also, captain of a 150 unconventional soldier strong unit. She had the authority to choose who was part of the unit, reason which, in the so-called rejects unit, you could find from rogues to paladins, half-orcs to elves, all working under Atefeh’s orders, all following out of respect of her imposing magic. Given her personality and closeness to the gods, <em>Li Zhu</em> took an interest in Atefeh. And given his ability with the sword and monastic discipline, Atefeh took an interest in <em>Li Zhu</em>. That’s how, for a period, <em>Li Zhu</em> was part of the war between Breland and Cyre. As a soldier, the monk got paid 8 pieces of gold. A lot for three months work.

                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        After many years of globe-trotting, <em>Li Zhu</em> went back to Yumai and from there to the monastery, where he spent a few years training new monks, until he decided to depart on one last journey towards enlightenment. By this time, he was already famous. A Monk known across many monasteries as the Wandering Monk. This last adventure took him to Guang Zhi Senlin, the forest of light. After months traveling through it, <em>Li Zhu</em> found himself in a clearing with a translucent, blue stair that disappeared into heaven. Understanding this would be his last time on the earthly plain in which his life had elapsed, the monk buried the bell and meditated in front of the little shrine he had erected. With this last action he said goodbye to the world of mortals and went up the stairs, into the astral plane, finally achieving enlightenment.

                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        So famous it became <em>Li Zhu</em>’s story, the Wandering Monk that found the light, that several monks started to follow his steps, his wandering in search for enlightenment. Li Jie was the first one to succeed in this quest thanks to the connection he achieved, through meditation, with <em>Li Zhu</em>’s soul. He was followed by two more monks, one with <em>Li Zhu</em>’s soul’s help, the other with Li Jie’s. Another four followed, with the help of their four predecessors that where now part of The Enlighted One. So, follow the progression until the stories where so famous outside of monastic circles that even normal people started following in the steps of the monks.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        Whoever started their own way to enlightenment and proved to be worthy, got the help of one of the multiple souls that made The Enlighted One. Men, women, elves, orcs, animals even following after their masters, got to be part of The Enlighted One. Eventually, monks in search of ascendance through <em>Li Zhu</em>’s teachings, built a monastery and founded the monastic tradition of the Astral Self, that tried to connect to The Enlighted One and its many facets. These monks, through millennia, maintained that The Enlighted One was one and many, a being made of everyone that ascended by <em>Li Zhu</em>’s journey, a being that kept the individual characteristics of every soul and at the same time acted as one.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        Two centuries ago, <em>Li Zhu</em>, as an individual soul contacted the monks of the astral self during their daily meditations. He told them how much he missed to step on the land, to feel the rain and smell the flowers, about how he felt he was still missing something to reach true enlightenment. He said there was a way to anchor his soul to an artificial construct through the symbol of Zun-Gun, so he could exist in the world as a unique being. And finally, he asked the monks to send people to Byltar so said construct could be fabricated. Two monks departed to the desert in the golden lands, where they found the most famous automaton creator and brought forward <em>Li Zhu</em>’s case. The craftsman told them that what they wanted was possible, hard and extremely expensive. The monks commissioned the creation of the automaton and went back to the monastery to get help moving it. For two hundred yeas the automaton sat in meditation on The Enlighted One’s altar, in the monastery, until finally a group of monks found Zun-Gun’s altar. Two years ago, the monks performed the ritual to anchor <em>Li Zhu</em>’s soul to the bell and the fragment was united with the body.

                        For a year <em>Li Zhu</em> trained in his new, artificial, body in the monastery, until he had a similar control to the one, he had of his own body. While now <em>Li Zhu</em> is one with the automaton, he can’t feel the world as he expected. Although he isn’t sure if his new body is a blessing or a curse, <em>Li Zhu</em>, went out to the world, again, in search of enlightenment.
