                        Welcome, esteemed reader.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        If you are part of the proud <b>Duergar</b> race it is not necessary for you to read this introduction. Although reading it will assuredly make your day happier. However, dear reader, if you aren’t a <b>Duergar</b>, this foreword is essential to understand the rest of this captivating retelling.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        If this tome finds itself, at this time, in possession of and being read by a dwarf, hopefully Laduguer will find your treasures and take them from you. Sadness and misery are the only things your race deserves.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        Finally, it is time to give a general retelling of the <b>Duergar</b> to anyone not familiarized with them. The proud <b>Duergar</b> race goes back to the first years of the world and shares its origins with the dwarves, but unlike them, their life wasn’t easy nor favored by the gods. The <b>Duergar</b> were enslaved by the Illithids from the Underdark.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        After centuries of torture and experimentation, a <b>Duergar</b> broke free of their wardens and through a pact with Asmodeus, the king of the nine circles, got his race free.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        Not everything was bad though, since the Illithid’s experiments on the <b>Duergar</b> gave this race magical and practical abilities of unimaginable usefulness.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        The <b>Duergar</b> are strong, resilient, working, untiring and, unlike their colorful “cousins”, honest. Dwarves insist with their old mantra “Quality, not quantity” and use it to justify their creations, modest in quality, irrational in pricing. Their focus is aesthetic, excuse for exorbitant prices on weapons that are little more than pretty paper weights and extravagant buildings uncapable of resisting the pounding of nature. On the other hand, the venerable <b>Duergar</b> live by the opposite mantra: quantity over quality. And, following this precept, they produce tools and structures with no focus on aesthetics. Because of this, in the time a dwarf makes a sword of inferior quality, covered in intricate runic patterns, a <b>Duergar</b> makes 50 superior swords made for war or self-defense, not for showing. Of course, the monetary value of this dwarven sword is, probably, equivalent to the 50, superior, <b>Duergar</b> weapons. Thus, proving that <b>Duergar</b> are not only more efficient, but more honest and fairer.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        The three precepts of this proud race are:
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        - <b>Our pockets are never full:</b> and the best way to augment our riches is through the constant, tireless working of the clans.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        - <b>Our battle is never over:</b> meaning, our work will give back to us our just place in the world.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        - <b>Our will is unbreakable:</b> that means <b>Duergar</b> never leave for tomorrow the work that could be done today. And, is possible, tomorrow’s work should also be done today.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        Being familiarized with the <b>Duergar</b>, reader friend, is time to begin our retelling of the <em>Thundermaster</em> Clan. The most important <b>Duergar</b> clan in the past two thousand and five hundred years of the Forgotten Realms.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        May Laduguer be with you during this reading and Deep Duerra give you the strength of mind to reach the end of our Story.

                        As mentioned in the first few chapters of our recollection, Travok <em>Thundermaster</em> was part of Laduguer’s army during the rebellion against the Illithids and every member of this force had to mate with Asmodeus’ demons, obligatorily, after the rebellion. We have also spoken about how every male born from this mix, for five generations, were delivered to Asmodeus’ army as payment for it’s support in the rebellion.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        It is now time to talk about <em>Dain</em> of Clan <em>Thundermaster</em> and how his actions would be the pebble that started the avalanche to change how the outer world perceived the <b>Duergar</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        <em>Dain</em> was the youngest of Rangrim and Anbera of Clan <em>Thundermaster</em>’s children. He was the last male boy to be born in the thirteenth generation of <em>Thundermasters</em>, 15 years after the rebellion of salves that separated the clan for more than a hundred years.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        Despite being born during turbulent times for the clan, <em>Dain</em> was lucky to grow in the <em>Thundermaster</em>’s ancestral mansion. And, although youth is rarely simple for a <b>Duergar</b>, for <em>Dain</em> was almost impossible. The family’s doctor held all his life that <em>Dain</em>’s issues came from the demonic blood inherited, in some strange way, through his mother, that had a stronger force on the boy’s mentality even after thirteen generations of dilution.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        During his first years <em>Dain</em> had an interest improper of a <b>Duergar</b> for aesthetic and used to, as an example, draw complicated line patterns and dress in flashy clothing. Because of this and other reasons young <b>Duergar</b> around his age saw him as a weird and different colleague, and most chose to cast him aside.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        As every <em>Thundermaster</em> before him, when reaching adulthood, at sixty years old, <em>Dain</em> was a superior mason and stonemason and his brother, Brottor <em>Thundermaster</em>, introduced him to the Guild of Masons and Stonemasons of Elementshold (the <b>Duergar</b> fortress in which the <em>Thundermasters</em> dwelled, as we’ve seen before).
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        During his seventy years in service of the Guild a different assortment of issues troubled <em>Dain</em> when it came to relating to his peers. He insisted that a structure could be both resistant and pleasant to look without sacrificing quality or adding work time. To which his colleagues invariably answer with insults and mockery.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        Our exemplary <b>Duergar</b> decided to show his devotion to Laduguer by getting the god’s broken arrow tattooed on his head. This proved troublesome both within the guild and his family, but it was ignored in lieu of cultivating <em>Dain</em>’s abilities.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        The straw that broke the camel’s back was the day <em>Dain</em> shared with his family that he was romantically interested in Darrak Firetamer, one of the Blacksmiths Guild’s associates and friend to <em>Dain</em> for decades. Rangrim, horrified by his son’s unnatural inclinations and his own incapacity of understanding the concept of love, decided it was time for <em>Dain</em> to go out to the outer world, and so avoid any further inconvenient.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        The official reason for his departure was the search of commercial routes and new business partners for the Guild. In reality, no one expected him to come back, and everyone was relieved after he was gone.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        <em>Dain</em> left an October night along an assault troop consisting of 17 <b>Duergar</b> warriors of different classes, three steeders (giant spiders used as mounts or beasts of burden) and a <b>Duergar</b> despot for a leader. The troop’s main objective was to gather new slaves (attacking specially any dwarf they came across) for Elementshold. <em>Dain</em> was to split before reaching the first settlement. At the moment of departure, Dariff <em>Thundermaster</em>, one of our hero’s older sisters, gave him a case with a pair of eye-glasses with obsidian lenses, specially cut and polished in such a way that day light would hurt <em>Dain</em>’s eyes a lot less.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        During the first camp day, after a long night of marching, <em>Dain</em> fell asleep immediately. In his dreams he visited the Faywild and, for the first time, lost within the woods adjacent to the mountain he had always called home, he understood how the <b>Duergar</b> Bastion’s smoke was destroying the mountain and the nature around it, probably affecting its denizens and the way they saw and interacted with the outside world. Come nightfall <em>Dain</em> woke up to a pack of wolves surrounding them, one for each dead member of the troop, while a bear fed of the corpse of the leader.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        This bear turned out to be Varis Alanodel (Moonwhisper), an elf druid, that offered to teach him the ways of the Moon Circle and help him to protect nature and the rest of the <b>Duergar</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        So, the druid’s apprentice learned to respect nature, to treat every living thing in the same way and to live by one simple precept: as the wolf’s actions have shown, the strength of the one is nothing compared to the power of the pack.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        After a decade of study, training and friendship with Varis, <em>Dain</em> was ready to become a druid officially. This meant a journey to the center of the forest, where he met Tenderspur a Treant Sage from whom he learned to think in years and decades instead of days and months.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        Tenderspur kept an owl, that used it as a hunter’s perch (for this Tenderspur would keep still for days, as to not disturb the bird of prey), and a Griffon named Gryffin.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        When Tenderspur judged <em>Dain</em>’s learning as enough to interact with the world as a druid it gave him a gift, a shoulder pad made of a piece of his own bark and decorated with feathers from the owl and Gryffin.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text__paragraph--align">
                        From that moment on, <em>Dain</em> would begin his journeys through the world and would make that little pebble roll, finally changing how everyone thought about the <b>Duergar</b> for millennia.
